# Star Trek Sounds Game Box

A handheld device that makes Star Treck TOS sounds and light animations, and plays meta puzzles of mystery.

Made from a broken keychain noisemaker for the sounds, driven by a transistor array controlled by an ATMega 8 MCU (which is what this C source code is for) an ipod shuffle store box.  The clear box nicely shows the chatic innards.  An array of 6 multicolor LEDs run animations for each of the sounds.  For example, the "red alert" sound is animated as bright red pulsing.  Two buttons control a menu system to choose between sounds to play and the mystery games.
